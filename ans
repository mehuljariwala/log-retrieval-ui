Handling large files, such as a 5GB log file, can indeed lead to performance issues due to memory constraints and processing time. Here are some strategies to mitigate these challenges:

Streaming Data: Use streaming techniques to process the file in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory at once. Node.js provides streaming APIs (fs.createReadStream) that allow you to read files incrementally, reducing memory usage.

Limit Response Size: Instead of returning the entire file content in the response, consider limiting the number of lines returned or implementing pagination to fetch data in smaller chunks. This can help prevent overwhelming the client and reduce the amount of data processed at once.

Optimize Search: If the client is searching for specific content within the log file, consider optimizing the search algorithm to minimize the number of iterations required. For example, you can use regular expressions or other efficient search techniques to filter the data.

Cache Results: Implement caching mechanisms to store previously fetched data and avoid reprocessing the entire file for repeated requests with the same parameters. This can significantly improve response times for subsequent requests.

Load Balancing and Scaling: If processing large files becomes a bottleneck, consider distributing the workload across multiple instances of your application using load balancing or leveraging cloud services that support scalable infrastructure.

Asynchronous Processing: Use asynchronous programming techniques to handle file I/O and data processing concurrently, allowing other requests to be processed while reading or processing the log file.
